# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake Game implemented using the Tkinter library in Python. The game consists of a snake that moves around the screen, trying to eat food and grow longer. The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible by eating food without colliding with the boundaries of the game or the snake's own body.

## Instructions
- Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the snake's direction.
- The snake will automatically move in the chosen direction at a constant speed.
- The game ends if the snake collides with the boundaries or its own body.
- Eating food increases the score by 1 and causes the snake to grow longer.
- Click the "Start New Game" button to start a new game.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library

## How to Run
1. Ensure that Python and Tkinter are installed on your system.
2. Copy the provided script into a Python file (e.g., `snake_game.py`).
3. Run the script using a Python interpreter: `python snake_game.py`.
4. The game window will appear, and you can start playing.

## Gameplay
- The snake is initially represented by a green color.
- The food is represented by a red oval.
- The score is displayed at the top of the game window.
